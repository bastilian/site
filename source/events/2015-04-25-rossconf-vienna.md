ROSSConf is a one day conference/hackathon to get more people submit their first contribution to an open source project by inviting maintainers or core contributors and their projects to join a group of around 60 attendees. Together with Floor Drees, the initiator of the event, Laura Gaetano, Aaron Curz we invited Katrina Owen, Michal Papis, Lisa Passing, Piotr Szotkowski and Arne Brasseur to Vienna to work with the attendees on projects like RVM, Diaspora, exercism, reek and Yaks.
