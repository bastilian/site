My main focus at icomedias was front end development for various clients
ensuring cross-browser compatibility, while retaining valid and semantic
HTML & CSS. Another big part was relaunching sites with WAI conformance
in mind.

All projects shared a proprietary CMS and a XML/XSLT based template-engine.
