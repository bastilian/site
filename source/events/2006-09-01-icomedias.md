My main focus at icomedias was front end development for various clients
ensuring cross-browser compatibility, while retaining valid and semantic
HTML & CSS. Another big part was relaunching sites with WAI conformance
in mind.

All projects shared a proprietary CMS and a XML/XSLT based template-engine.

**Some Projects**

*   **Land Steiermark**

    A relaunch 2007 of the portal required reworking XSLT templates to semantic HTML and ensuring compliance with WAI guidelines. Stylesheets were written to allow flexible styling for different municipal authorities.

*   **Rentenbank**
    ![Rentenbank Logo](/events/2006/09/01/icomedias/rentenbank.png)
    Rentenbank relaunched it's website 2007 requiring multilingual templates and a accessible front end for their customers. A minor highlight is the almost purely CSS driven menu.
