As a Application Support Engineer and part of the global 24/7 Support team, I was working closely with customers, partners and infrastructure providers, through the support ticketing system and via phone/Skype, helping them set up and configure their environments as well as deploy their applications and help resolve issues through out the whole stack if they occur. The work also included proactive monitoring of instances, systems and services, like web and application servers, databases and background processes on managed environments.

After the acquisition of OpDemand and their Docker based PaaS Deis, my focus was on working with customers provision their clusters on AWS and containerize their applications to deploy them.
