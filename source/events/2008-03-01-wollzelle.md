Improving and maintaining the Ruby and Rails based digital asset management application Fluxiom.com was the main project I was working on at wollzelle. Implementing new features in the Prototype & Scriptaculous based front and on the server side was part of the work on Fluxiom as well as handling day to day tasks for it like customer support and operations tasks.

while also
working on projects for clients including Casinos Austria International,
Gucci, Raumkunst and St. Gilgen Int. School.
