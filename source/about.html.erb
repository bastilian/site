  I started working as a web developer in 2006 doing mainly frontend development and working on projects with Rails in my spare time.
  In 2008 I went on working with Rails at my day-job, improving and maintaining <a href="http://fluxiom.com">Fluxiom</a> as well as building custom solutions for clients based on BrowserCMS, Mephisto and WordPress, including building rich JavaScript frontends.
  After more than 2 years I took a little detour and learned ColdFusion while working at a small agency for a while.
  To work with Ruby and Rails again and started working for <a href="http://tupalo.com">Tupalo.com</a>.
  After a period of freelancing and working for startups, like whatchado, I joined <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a> as <strong>Application Support Engineer</strong>.
