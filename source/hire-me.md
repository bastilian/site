If you like what you see here and think I might be a good addition to your team, don't hesitate to get in touch with me [via email](mailto:sebastian@validcode.me). I like to hear about positions ranging from development in front and backend to support positions. If you need to know a little bit more about myself keep on reading.

### What do you really know?

I worked as a programmer for more than ten years at various companies and on many projects, from small web and full-service agencies building sites for customers to a international operating hosting company, as well as a few startups. I primarily use  Ruby or JavaScript (on Node.js) for backend software and the usual front end stack of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I built software based on Rails and Sinatra and a few other frameworks. In the past I liked to work with frameworks in the front end, like Prototype.js, Script.aculo.us and MooTools, and of course jQuery, and for a while Backbone.js, but nowadays I prefer to avoid these dependencies and use vanilla JavaScript and build upon ES6 features first, before deciding to jump on a framework.

I worked with databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL and while I'm no `JOIN`-guru, I understand how to query data properly and performant. In a few projects I use NoSQL databases like MongoDB and RethinkDB to explore their features and be able to work with a schema-less database to add changes faster.

To deploy my applications I like to setup servers on Linux preferably with nginx or in the past with Apache, either on bare metal machines or cloud providers like AWS and OpenShift. To keep them monitored I like to use monit or nagios, depending on the size and use of the server. I also have a number of applications deployed on Heroku and helped customers deploy their application and stack on AWS, while working as a Application Support Engineer.

### Why did you work as a Application Support Engineer?

I heard once that GitHub puts every developer into their support team for a bit. I found that intriguing and set out to get a position in support and had the pleasure to join and work at Engine Yard, who host applications for their customers on managed infrastructure and cloud services, which is probably the best environment to work in support as a web developer, since problems arise and solutions need to be found in the whole of a web application stack. From debugging browser issues caused by mismatching SSL certificates to ensuring proper database replication, every issue comes up at least once and offers the perfect place to learn even more and help others in the process. In addition to the technical aspects of the job it also improves communication skills and it allowed me to work remote.

### Why is working remote a good thing?

Working remotely allows, besides the obvious cut of the commute, to focus on work in a place of my choosing and contributes positively to a work life balance. I'm a programmer, from the moment I get up to falling asleep, I like to work most of the time and be flexible to fit in other things like traveling, visiting conferences, coach at workshops, give talks, organize developer events or spend time working on open source projects and still have enough time to enjoy life.

### You contribute to open source?

Yes. Open source is an integral part of a developers life, almost all our jobs are based on open source and I feel it is important to be part of it and contribute to it, be it at workshops, meetups and conferences or by improving documentation, developing new features and bug fixing. Therefore I feel it's important that my job has to allow me to continue to be a part of the open source community, maybe even encourage it or have it as a part of the job.

### OK, When can you start?
